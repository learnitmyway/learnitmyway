This is the source code for [my website](https://www.learnitmyway.com).
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is used as a static site generator and it is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
The layout and styles originate from the [Ananke](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke) theme.

Have a look at [How I release updates to my personal website](https://www.learnitmyway.com/how-i-release-updates-to-my-personal-website/) for more information on the tools, processes and practices I use for releasing updates to this website.
