  Developing mobile apps is really exciting because they are easily accessible to everyone. There comes a point in time when one has to choose which platform to specialise in. This post discusses the two main reasons why I chose Android over iOS.
</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align:justify;">
  <b>Becoming an expert in Android requires less time</b>. Android apps are typically written in Java, which is the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular programming language</a> and it has been around for quite a while. This means there is a lot of <a href="http://learnitmyway.com/2016/11/11/learning-material-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning material</a> out there to help you to quickly become highly proficient in the language.<br /> Swift is a very new programming language used to develop iOS apps. Because it is new, there aren&#8217;t as many resources to help you like there are with Java. The <a href="http://learnitmyway.com/2016/11/11/learning-material-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning material</a> I have used was at times quite hard to follow because of the changing syntax between different Swift versions.<br /> Objective C can also be used to write iOS apps. I have very little experience with Objective C but according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc&feature=youtu.be&t=41s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some, it should have died out a long time ago</a>.
</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align:justify;">
  <strong>Android&#8217;s tools are better. </strong>Android Studio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to develop Android apps and is a pleasure to use (auto format, auto complete, detecting compile errors and refactoring existing code are all possible with Android Studio).<br /> xCode is the IDE used to develop iOS apps and it is not so amazing. It is quite buggy &#8211; sometimes it would crash for no reason and I found it quite unintuitive (especially the storyboard).
</p>

I decided Android was a better choice because one can quickly become an expert in Java and it has a superior IDE. This allows me to have more fun building apps that are of higher quality. A clear win for me.
