- **Takeaways**:
  - Taking breaks (and activating the “diffuse” mode) helps you to solve problems
  - Changing your learning environment stimulates the brain
  - Procrastination can be overcome by taking the first step
  - Writing things down can free up your working memory

### [**The Tim Ferriss Show**](https://tim.blog/podcast/)

Podcast

- **Length:** approx. 2 hours each.
- **Takeaways**:
  - Seek uncomfortable challenges
  - Keep a daily appreciation journal
  - You are the average of the people you spend the most time with
