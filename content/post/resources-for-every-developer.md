In my career, I have consumed a lot of content on writing maintainable code, career tips, object orientated programming and DevOps. Some of the resources I have even revisited. This list contains the ones worth recommending.

<!--more-->

## Assumed Knowledge

To get the most out of these resources you should be comfortable with at least one object orientated programming language and be interested in a career developing software.

If you feel you need to brush up on some of your Java skills for some of the resources I would recommend [Learn Java with these Resources](https://learnitmyway.com/2017/07/02/learn-java-with-these-resources/), which are the resources I used and recommend.

## Resources

The following resources can be consumed at any time and in any order.

### [Clean Code - Bob Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)

One of the classics, this book gets you thinking in the right direction when it comes to designing software that is reusable, maintainable, flexible and scalable. I found the explanation of TDD to be particularly useful.

- **Type**: Book
- **Length**: ~250 pages
- **Language**: Java
- **Note**: I skipped chapters >= 16
- **My key take-aways**:
  - later = never
  - comments tend to a lie after a while
  - unit tests make our code more flexible
  - write dirty code and then clean in

### [Clean Code Video Series - Bob Martin](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780134661742/)

After reading Clean Code I can highly recommend watching the video series to make the lessons more concrete, especially
the videos on TDD.

- **Type**: Video
- **Length**: ~1 hour per video with 10+ videos
- **Language**: Java
- **Note**: I skipped the astronomy segments at the beginning of each lesson and the episodes on architecture and BDD.

### [Clean Coder - Bob Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder?from_search=true)

This book gives you a great insight into the Bob Martin’s professional life as a software engineer
and is a fun book to read. Full of handy tips for a career in software development.

- **Type**: Book
- **Length**: 210 pages

### [97 things every programmer should know](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7003902-97-things-every-programmer-should-know?ac=1&from_search=true)

I enjoyed reading this book and although I didn’t I agree with all of the tips, some of them were really useful. You could read this book over 97 days and it wouldn't be a problem.

- **Type**: Video
- **Length**: 258 pages
- **Favourite tips**:
  - The boy scout rule
  - Fulfil your ambitions with open source
  - Hard work does not pay off
  - Keep the build clean
  - Learn foreign languages
  - Make the invisible more visible
  - Pair program and feel the flow
  - Reinvent the wheel often

### [Head First Design Patterns - E. Freeman et al.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns)

This is a great book for learning about design patterns, design principles and object orientated programming. I wrote my own examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/DesignPatterns) to help me consolidate the material.

- **Type**: Book
- **Length**: 638 pages
- **Language**: Java

### [Accelerate: Building and Scaling High-Performing Technology Organizations - Nicole Forsgren et al.](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35747076-accelerate)

Want to know what differs high-performing software-delivery teams from low-performing ones? This book answers this question.

- **Type**: Book
- **Length**: 257 pages
- **Key take-aways**:
  - Branches should be less than a day's work
  - Highest performing teams have the shortest integration times. Branches typically last hours or a day. Low performers have branches typically lasting days or weeks
  - Deployment pain correlates with low performance and low satisfaction
  - Gender diverse teams perform better
  - Teams that have space to experiment and learn perform better
  - Queue theory: As utilisation approaches 100% the speed at which work is completed (lead time) approaches infinity

### [The Phoenix Project - Gene Kim et al.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project)

This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. It reads like a novel and it is uncanny how realistic it is.

- **Type**: Book
- **Length**: 354 pages
- **Key take-aways**:
  - Theory of Constraints: any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion
  - Left unchecked, technical debt will ensure that the only work that gets done is unplanned work
  - Until code is in production, no value is actually being generated
  - Every industry and company that is not bringing software to the core of their business will be disrupted

### [The DevOps Handbook - Gene Kim et al.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26083308-the-devops-handbook)

- **Type**: Book
- **Length**: 437 pages
- **Key take-aways**:
  - Interrupting technology workers is easy because the consequences are invisible to almost everyone
  - We can introduce tension into our systems by reducing deployment lead times. Introducing tension forces us to improve
  - The leader’s role is to create the conditions so their team can discover greatness in their daily work
  - 20% of an iteration should be allocated to create positive, user-invisible value (eg. paying down tech debt)
  - Do whatever it takes to keep the build green
  - Feature branches delay feedback
  - Feature toggles enable the decoupling of code deployments and feature releases
  - Business metrics should be defined at the earliest stage of feature definition
  - If we are not performing user research, the odds are that two-thirds of the features we are building deliver zero or negative value to our organization
  - Out-experiment the competition

Timeline:

- August 2020: Added 'The DevOps Handbook'
- July 2020: Added 'Accelerate' and 'Phoenix Project'
- March 2019: Extracted from [Learning Material - Software Development](https://learnitmyway.com/learning-material-software-development/)
