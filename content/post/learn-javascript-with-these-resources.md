_In this article, I share a list of the recommended resources that have helped me learn JavaScript._

<!--more-->

When Stack Overflow did their 2017 survey, JavaScript was the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-popular-technologies" 
target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular programming language</a>. I think this is a good enough reason 
to start learning it. Out of the seemingly unlimited set of resources out there 
I would like to share the ones that helped me and were worth the time investment.

Before starting with these resources you should have knowledge of computer science fundamentals. 
My recommendations can be found in 
<a href="https://www.learnitmyway.com/2017/06/04/learn-how-to-code-with-these-resources/" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener">Learn how to code with these resources</a>. If you already have a strong base, the resources
below can be completed in the order they are written.

**<a href="http://www.wickedlysmart.com/hfjs/" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener">Head First JavaScript Programming</a>** (2014) Freeman and Robson
Textbook

As soon as saw that this book was written by the same authors as 
<a href="http://www.wickedlysmart.com/head-first-design-patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
noreferrer">Head First Design Patterns</a> it was an obvious choice for me to start learning JavaScript. 
It is written so well that an introductory course in computer science is enough prior knowledge to understand 
this book fully. In my case I already knew Java, so I felt I was able to grasp the concepts quite quickly. 
Minimal knowledge of HTML and CSS is also required, 
but that is quite easy to pick up if you haven&#8217;t seen it before 
(eg. from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">w3schools</a>). 
By the end of the book &#8220;you are well on your way to becoming a JavaScript expert&#8221; 
according to the authors and that seems like an honest statement to me!

**<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Code Camp</a>** (2017)  
Tutorials and projects

Free Code Camp has really helped to consolidate my JavaScript skills. 
On <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/developerdavo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my FCC profile</a>, 
you can see everything that I have completed. I found the intermediate and advanced projects 
to be particularly useful after reading Head First JavaScript Programming.

**<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener">JavaScript Testing</a>** (2017) Udacity  
Online Course

If you are not familiar with testing in JS (with Jasmine) or how to do 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TDD</a>, 
this course offers a great introduction.

**<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015" target="_blank" 
rel="noopener">Object Orientated JavaScript</a>** (2017) Udacity  
Online Course

If you would like to deepen your knowledge of some of the lesser known things about JavaScript, this course 
offers some really good insights into the language. The course seems to be catered for people who are learning
JS as their first language, so I was able to get through the course quite quickly. 
Oh, and the final project is really fun!

**<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/es6-javascript-improved--ud356" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
ES6 &#8211; JavaScript Improved</a>** (2017) Udacity  
Online Course

This is by far the easiest and best way to learn ES6 that I have encountered. 
This is considered an advanced course by Udacity standards, 
which means you need to have some experience with JavaScript already (like the resources above!).
I highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking to get the most out of JS and/or considering 
learning about Angular or React. The course took me around 8 hours to complete.
